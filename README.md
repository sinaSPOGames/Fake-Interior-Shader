# [Edited] Interior Mapping (Fake Interior) Shader For Godot Engine (LTS)

Updated Fake Interior Mapping shader for the Godot Game Engine 3.x that works with both GLES3 and GLES2.
This shader is an optimization measure used in game development to increase performance while keeping a good visual quality,
This is the technique used in the Sims, Forza Horizon, Spiderman and other open-world games.

A while back (about 3 years ago) I made an interior mapping shader adaptation for the Godot Engine,
It was kind of limited and lacked more advanced features that where added in this version.

For your question contact me on twitter but please note that I don't use social media that much.
